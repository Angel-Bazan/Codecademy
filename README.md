### Arrays 
Arrays are JavaScript's way of making lists. Arrays can store any data types (including strings, numbers, and booleans). Like lists, arrays are ordered, meaning each item has a numbered position. 

### Create an Array 
One way we can create an array is to use an array literal. An array literal creates an array by wrapping items in square brackets. Arrays can store any date type . Each content item inside an array is called an element

### Accessing Elements 
Each element in an array has a numbered position known as its index. We can access individual items usind their index. Arrays in JavaScript are zero indexed, meaning the positions start counting from 0 rather than 1. Therefore, the first item in an array will be at position 0. You can also access individual characters in a string using bracket notation and the index. 

# bracket notation example 
```jsx 
const hello = 'Hello World';
console.log(hello[6]);
```
